# Description

This website provides fundamental algorithm descriptions and runtimes. The `index.html` file contains a brief
list of algorithms and a table that shows runtimes and remarks. Each algorithm has a `.html` file with more visual and
textual description. In addition, the index file has stylesheet `main.css` and the other files have stylesheet
`pages.css`.

# Additional Information

The linked algorithm pages still need to be updated for content and style.
