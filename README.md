# Description

This website provides fundamental algorithm descriptions and runtimes. The `index.html` file contains a brief
list of algorithms and a table that shows runtimes and remarks. Each algorithm has a `.html` file with more visual and
textual description. In addition, the index file has stylesheet `main.css` and the other files have stylesheet
`pages.css`.

# Todo

The linked algorithm pages still need to be updated for content (specifics on algs) and style:
1. 5 CSS properties/selectors
2. Media query for smaller screens
3. 1 Bootstrap4 component, 2 Bootstrap4 columns using Grid Model
4. 1 SCSS variable, nesting, inheritance
